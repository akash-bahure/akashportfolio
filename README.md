## Problems Faced During Production

### SMTP Integration with Bravo

- **Issue:** Initial integration with Bravo SMTP faced authentication errors.
- **Solution:** Correctly configured the SMTP credentials in the `.env` file and ensured the nodemailer transport settings matched the Bravo SMTP requirements.

### Hashnode API Rate Limits

- **Issue:** Fetching a large number of blog posts in a single request sometimes hit the API rate limit.
- **Solution:** Implemented pagination and limited the number of blog posts fetched per request.

### Deployment Issues

- **Issue:** Deployment to the hosting platform occasionally failed due to environment variable misconfigurations.
- **Solution:** Ensured all required environment variables were correctly set in the hosting platform's configuration.

### CORS Errors

- **Issue:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors when the frontend tried to access the backend API.
- **Solution:** Configured the cors middleware in the Express backend to allow requests from the frontend domain.

### React Router URL Issues

- **Issue:** When using React Router for client-side routing in your single page application (SPA), URL routes not working when a page is refreshed, written manually, or shared.
- **Solution:** Added necessary routes in the server configuration to handle server-side routing.

## Deployment

### Vercel and CI/CD Pipeline

- **Description:** The project is deployed on Vercel with a CI/CD pipeline. Any changes pushed to the Git repository trigger a new deployment on Vercel, ensuring the site is always up-to-date with the latest changes.
- **Steps:** Configure the Vercel project with the GitHub repository, set up environment variables in Vercel, and ensure the `vercel.json` configuration file includes necessary routes and settings.
